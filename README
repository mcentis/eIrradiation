This program draws heavily from several Geant4 examples.
Each file states which example it originates from.

5.5 MeV electrons are shoot onto an Al layer of variable thickness.
The spectra of electrons and photons are recorded after the absorber.
To modify the energy of the electrons and Al thickness, use the variables in the run.mac file.
For the execution and compilation of the program see the README of the beta setup simulation program.
